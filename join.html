            <h3>Founding Engineer</h3>
            <div>
                Wally is a crypto infrastructure company that is helping to onboard the next billion users onto crypto
                products. We are working on a unique approach to signing people up for crypto apps to ensure that people
                don’t have to store private keys, and they can log into crypto products with just a username and
                password.
                We believe that people should never have to worry about losing a private key that protects a significant
                portion of their net worth or sign blockchain transactions that they don’t understand. We have already
                have companies that want to beta test our product.
            </div>
            <div>
                We are looking for a founding engineer to take over the API, build out the related backend services,
                recruit and lead new team members, and contribute in countless other ways to help build the business.

                <h6>About Wally</h6>
                Wally makes it easy to integrate wallets into an application without needing in-house blockchain
                and security expertise. We make it simple for companies to provide the ease-of-use that users are
                accustomed to from top consumer crypto apps like Dapper, Sorare, and Coinbase without the onerous
                technical and regulatory efforts that those companies had to go through.
            </div>
            <div>
                Wally has raised $1.5M from a series of top-notch early stage funds and angel investors, led by
                Afore.vc,
                Engineering Capital (Ashmeet Sidana), and top angels including Justin Kan, Matt Knox (Reddit), Sriram
                Krishnan, Garrett Lord (Handshake), Hareesh Nagaraj (Audius), Shiva Rajaraman (Head of Product,
                OpenSea),
                Lydia Hylton (Bain Capital Crypto), Dan Porter (Overtime), and Meera Clark (Obvious Ventures).
            </div>
            <div>
                We’re based in NYC and looking to hire in NYC. We believe that in-person collaboration is strategically
                important for a company at our stage — both for velocity and company culture.
