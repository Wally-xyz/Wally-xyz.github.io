            <h3>Founding Engineer</h3>
            <div>
                Wally is a crypto infrastructure company that is helping to onboard the next billion users onto crypto
                products. We are working on a unique approach to securing wallets to ensure that people don’t have to store
                private keys, and log into crypto products with just a username and password. People should never have to
                worry about losing a private key that protects a significant portion of their net worth or signing
                individual blockchain transactions. We have already have companies that want to beta test our product.
            </div>
            <div>
                We are looking for a founding engineer to take over the custodial wallet API, build out the related backend
                services, recruit and lead more team members, and contribute in countless other ways to help build the
                business.

                <h6>About Wally</h6>
                Wally makes it easy to integrate custodial wallets into an application without needing in-house blockchain
                and security expertise. We make it simple for companies to provide the ease-of-use that users are accustomed
                to from top consumer crypto apps like Dapper, Sorare, and Coinbase without the onerous technical effort and
                regulatory efforts that those companies had to go through.
            </div>
            <div>

                impacted nearly every facet of the business, including user growth, subreddit growth, revenue and safety.
